        <h2>When form meets function</h2>
        <p>I began as an artist with a goal; making creative interactions. Before the introduction of the personal computer, I'd spend a lot of resources on my work with little exposure. Technology advanced and I began using digital mediums to try new ideas; finally landing in the web.</p>
        <p>After 20 years of writing code for memorable experiences, I've found my purpose in life; to not only produce but to also pass this knowledge to others.</p>
