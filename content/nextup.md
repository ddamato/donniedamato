summary: When organizing a competitive event, directing your competitors to a gaming area is a challenge. The event will likely have many distractions; time is lost trying to locate them and record results accurately. This project was an attempt to solve this problem with a little bit of technology.

I've ran video game tournaments for a few years and one of the biggest things that will slow the event down is finding the people who are in the next match. After the first hour, many people begin taking breaks or watching other matches. Searching for the people in a tournament bracket becomes the most difficult thing that day to keep the event moving.

> As a tournament organizer, I want to contact participants about their matches **without searching for them** throughout a venue.

The important part for me was that I didn't want the participants to need to download an app. I wanted the system to just work with their phone through SMS. I made a system that describe the stations where matches would be held and allowed the competitors to text the results of the match back to the organizer. There were checks in place to ensure the results were accurate and results would automatically be uploaded to bracketing software. As long as the competitors engaged with their phones, the system would automatically run the tournament.

This was the first project where I needed to learn backend technologies and admittedly this was a huge undertaking. I needed several database tables and needed to make calls to the Twilio API to send and receive SMS messages accurately. It was a great learning experience and ultimately helped me understand the requirements of an entire development stack.
