summary: From being responsible for the CSS across the platform to creating the framework-agnostic global navigation for our products, I earned influence across the organization from nearly every angle. A leader among design and engineering teams and well known throughout the company as a person who delivered quality results.

Later I was responsible for the global navigation of the internal site which was to be injected into every application. It was important to understand the current state of each individual application; as they were built by different teams in various methods. The final deliverable was able to be rendered on the client or server. It was also framework-agnostic; able to be included in legacy and modern applications.

I also mentored the engineers in the brand and marketing department in ways to align with our existing engineering model and to upgrading existing technologies to better support the needs of the business.

Toward the end of my tenure at Compass, I grew the Design Systems team to include product designers, content writers and additional UX engineers. I led the team to consider novel ways of supporting our designers and engineers in creating a consistent look-and-feel for Compass and the internal tools for real estate agents. Much of my work continues to exist on the site and within the application today.
