Teaching has always been a passion of mine and it's important to me that people also find their passions. While code is a booming industry with a lot of opportunity, it's important to find the right career for each individual. Sometimes the concepts that I teach will never interest a student and it's important to recognize this early. It's not about enrollment, it's about impact.

My teaching methods take real-world, everyday concepts and then write code to describe them. In other words, creating an `add()` function is mostly useless. Instead we talk about warming up pizza in the microwave and that the appliance can be considered a function with inputs; returning edible food as a result. This approach is useful for people just learning about code for the first time so they can start thinking conditionally or about orders of operations and less about getting the syntax right.
