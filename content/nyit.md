summary: After finishing my Masters degree, I was asked by the chair of the Communication Arts department to teach new students about live event production as I had experience in the entertainment industry prior to college. Together we created a curriculum that continues to exhibit how much being prepared can affect the value of the final outcome.

I was first full-time instructor for Globesville, a student-run media channel originally on the Old Westbury campus. Students were grouped into teams that would produce their own weekly shows to be streamed live on our website for the majority of the semester. Grades were determined by production quality, engagement, and content. The end of the semester concluded with a marathon show where each team would need to work together to produce several hours of content to be live for the entire school day. This highlights the importance of collaboration and preparing for technical difficulties. Understandng how to work in a live production environment helps students understand the importance of prepareness for endeavors beyond media.
