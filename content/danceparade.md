Dance Parade is a yearly event in New York City that celebrates the joy of dance. It has been held on a weekend in May every year since 2007 and I've been visiting since the very first. After being noticed by one of the lead volunteers as a dancer who draws a crowd, I was asked to volunteer for the next parade. The following year and for the years since then, I've been deemed the "Voice of Dance Parade", and responsible for announcing each of the groups performing on our main stage for the entire afternoon. Sometimes, I might even do a quick dance performance of my own. Be sure to visit me sometime; it a great event to kickoff the summer in the city.
