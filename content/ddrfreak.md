From the time I was young, I was a video-game enthusiast. While I would go to the arcade often to play, it wasn't until I was introduced to Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) that I would find something that would connect me with other gamers with a similar interest. While DDR is often cited as having health benefits, this was a social benefit for me. DDR was the gateway to introduce me into the different neighborhoods of New York City, different cultures, and more meaningful friendships.

DDR Freak was the website where DDR players from all around the world would communicate about the game, their neighborhood arcade, or where they might travel to meet local players. At its peak, the community forum was one of the top 10 largest on the web. It was here that I learned about tournaments outside of my area and decided to travel with some friends to compete. I've since won several of those tournaments and became well-known under my pseudonym "Phrekwenci".

I became a community moderator and later an administrator due to my daily activity on the forums by helping newcomers in getting started and policing malicious behavior quickly. I was the lead administrator until the forums closed due to low activity after Konami paused new versions and sent lawsuits to imitators. However, this is a testament to my early influence and community engagement skills with an overall helpful nature and positive attitude in joining people together under a common good.
