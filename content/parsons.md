Learning about user experience research is a great way to start on a journey in product development. A good idea can become better when really understanding your audience and making decisions based on feedback. This course teaches the basics of UX research by way of video lessons and discussion boards. Students either pick a hypothetical project or begin research on their own ideas. Student then begin preparing their research presentation with user personas, competitive analysis, and journey maps to help inform their product. Each week I provide feedback on their projects with recommendations on other areas to include or questions to consider. The important focus is to find the truth, not to validate an idea.
