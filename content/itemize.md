headline: Itemize
summary: A side project leveraging modern development techniques at the company turned into a full site-wide application rewrite. I was able to prototype workflow possibilities faster than other teams could fully realize the potential. This was only the beginning of my responsibilities to come.

I was hired at Itemize to take their web application to the next level. It was originally an aspx-driven product which desprately needed an upgrade to use single-page application techniques. The team also didn't have a designer so I was also able to leverage my design experience to help inform product managers and contractors overseas on other design needs.

After finishing the smaller data-visualization project in the first month, I began rebuilding their consumer-facing web application from scratch. The project was complete and ready for production in about 4 months. Then I set my focus on improving the internal processing tools that were used daily by the auditors. I collected their feedback and made improvements to the experience to help them work faster and more accurately. I also built metrics dashboards for the marketing department to track users and usage across the globe.

Over the coming years I led the product development lifecycle reporting directly to the CEO; collaborating with the rest of the engineering team. I was also involved in the hiring process for senior members of other departments being recognized as a cultural influence for the company.
