I've been both a designer and an engineer for a number of years and I've seen the way we create web pages evolve with different strategies and theories during that time. Many people have changed the way we work on the web for better or worse. However, some things haven't changed much. One example of something that hasn't changed is the design grid and its relationship with web design.

Designers commonly use the design grid to help layout the elements of their design in a structured manner. This makes following Gestalt Principles easier, a staple in design thinking. This is normally a fine method to craft a message since the medium doesn't change. The web is different; especially with the introduction of responsive design.

> How might we educate traditional designers about the **limitations of the design grid** and provide alternative approaches to produce resuable experiences?

The thesis provides the history of the design grid, what designers can do to avoid it, and what engineers can code as possible solutions. The creation of an experience is a collaborative effort between experts and a little more knowledge will certainly make it better.
