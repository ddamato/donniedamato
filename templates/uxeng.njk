  I have built and maintained design systems for large companies by being an active liasion between the product design and engineering teams. I have interdisplicinary skills in both art and technology, which help craft solutions for different needs. My interest in design systems comes from a curiousity about how the entire system is viewed by the user; how they respond and interact with it.</p>

I work in code so my deliverables can be wired into existing codebases as an accurate developer handoff; ready for the world to experience.</p>
